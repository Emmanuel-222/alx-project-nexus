The **ProDev Frontend Engineering Program** is a structured, hands-on learning experience designed to equip aspiring developers with the practical skills and mindset needed to thrive in today’s tech industry. Whether you're just starting out or looking to sharpen your frontend skills, the program provides a clear path to mastering modern frontend development.

## 2. Goals & Objectives
The primary goal of the program is to turn learners into job-ready frontend engineers capable of building high-quality, responsive web and mobile interfaces. It emphasizes practical learning, problem-solving, and project development using the most in-demand tools and technologies in frontend engineering.

**Key objectives include:**
- Building real-world frontend applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
- Learning modern development workflows including Git, GitHub, and deployment tools.
- Developing the ability to reason through UI/UX decisions and write clean, maintainable code.
- Gaining confidence through mentorship, peer collaboration, and regular assessments.

## 3. Curriculum Breakdown
The program takes learners from the foundations to advanced concepts in a progressive manner.

**Core modules include:**
- **HTML & CSS** – structuring web pages, responsive design, Flexbox, Grid
- **JavaScript** – variables, functions, DOM manipulation, ES6+ features
- **React.js** – components, state, props, hooks, conditional rendering
- **React Native** – for building cross-platform mobile apps
- **Version Control** – Git & GitHub for collaboration and project management
- **APIs & Asynchronous JS** – working with real-time data
- **Bonus Tools** – Tailwind CSS, Figma for design, and deployment basics

Each module is project-driven, encouraging learners to build apps like portfolios, dashboards, blogs, and simple mobile interfaces.

## 4. Teaching Methodology
The ProDev program is built on **learning by doing**. Lectures are paired with real projects and coding exercises to reinforce each concept. The pace is structured to allow beginners to follow along while still challenging them to grow.

**The program includes:**
- Live coding sessions and Q&A
- Assignments and code reviews
- Weekly progress check-ins
- Personalized feedback from mentors

## 5. Tools & Platforms
Students learn in an environment that mirrors real-world developer setups:

- **Code Editors:** VS Code  
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub  
- **Design & UI Tools:** Figma  
- **React Native:** Using Expo for mobile development  
- **Communication:** Slack/Discord and online community forums

## 6. Assessments & Projects
Every stage of learning is accompanied by:

- Hands-on projects (e.g., a YouTube-to-MP3 app, e-commerce UI, responsive landing pages)
- Timed quizzes and weekly checkpoints
- Group challenges or code pairing sessions
- A final capstone project to demonstrate all learned skills

These tasks ensure students are not just watching tutorials but actively building.
